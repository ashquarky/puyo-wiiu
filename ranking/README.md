# meganex Ranking

the intent is for this to be a fully generic Ranking that can eventually be merged into -common (like matchmaking is today)

## todo
- friends, nearby, self rankings (requires updates to nex-protocols-go and nex-protocols-common-go)
- timescope (needs research); rankingscoredata.UpdateMode
- GetCommonData (requires updates to nex-protocols-common-go)
- switch to materialised views (or even real tables?) - benchmark this!
